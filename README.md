Get Next Line

Get Next Line is a project centered around implementing a reusable function that reads input line by line from a file descriptor.
Its primary goal is to teach how to manage persistent state across function calls while handling dynamic input efficiently.

The project highlights key concepts such as buffered reading, memory ownership, and the careful use of static data to preserve context between calls. It also reinforces robustness by requiring the function to behave consistently across different input sources and usage patterns.

Get Next Line develops an understanding of stream-based input processing and encourages writing defensive, well-structured code that can be safely reused in larger systems.
