Get Next Line

Get Next Line is a project from the 42 curriculum that consists in implementing a function capable of reading a file descriptor line by line.
It introduces the use of static variables, efficient buffer management, and careful memory handling.
The goal is to create a reliable and reusable function that works with files, standard input, and varying buffer sizes, while respecting strict C constraints
